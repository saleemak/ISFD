Image Splicing Forgery Detection
Hello! I'm Saleema, a researcher with a passion for integrating physics-informed principles into image processing and machine learning.
I'm particularly interested in Digital Image Correlation (DIC), Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), and innovative image forensics techniques.
I specialize in implementing machine learning methodologies, designing loss functions, and adapting established techniques for unique applications.
I'm currently exploring applications of DIC for image forgery detection and investigating the potential of PINNs in image forensics.
Ilove collaborating on interdisciplinary projects. Feel free to reach out if you're working on something exciting!

Image Splicing Forgery Detection
Hello! I'm Saleema, a researcher in image processing. I'm particularly interested in digital image integrity on social media, medical image processing, and innovative image forensics techniques. I specialize in implementing machine learning methodologies and adapting established techniques for unique applications. Currently, I'm exploring image forgery detection techniques and the potential of PINNs in image forensics. I love collaborating on interdisciplinary projects, so feel free to reach out if you're working on something exciting!
